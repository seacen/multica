// ChannelOutboxMetrics is the production implementation of the outbound
// queue's metrics sink (the Metrics interface in
// internal/integrations/channel/outbox).
//
// channel_type is the only identifying label: it is bounded by the number of
// adapters, and without it a dead realtime path on one platform hides inside
// another's traffic. Deliberately no installation_id or workspace_id anywhere
// — that is the unbounded cardinality forbiddenMetricLabels rejects outright.
// What that costs is worth stating rather than waving away: NO call site here
// writes a log line beside the counter it increments. Producer carries no
// logger at all (only a LogValue that names the channel type), and Consumer's
// complete / terminate / retryOrFail and Reconciler's race-lost counter each
// record and return. So a rising series says some installation on this
// platform is affected and not which one, and the answer has to be read out of
// the channel_outbound_queue rows themselves. The other label values go
// through fixed allow-lists so a caller cannot widen the series space either.
