// WecomMetrics is the production sink behind the WeCom adapter's Metrics
// interface (server/internal/integrations/wecom/metrics.go).
//
// The adapter is built to degrade quietly. A dial that fails and a handshake
// the server refuses both yield the connection back to the Supervisor, which
// backs off and tries again; an ingest queue the read loop has to wait on
// yields nothing and simply stops draining the socket until the worker
// catches up. None of the three changes anything an operator can see. A bot
// that has been down since Tuesday and a bot nobody happened to message today
// produce the same silence.
//
// The two connection counters are deliberately separate. A dial or a read that
// fails is infrastructure and usually recovers on its own; a handshake the
// server refuses on its merits is a wrong secret or a deleted bot, and it will
// repeat identically on every backoff until a person fixes the installation.
// Summed into one number the operator cannot tell "wait" from "rotate the
// credential".
//
// No installation_id label anywhere. It is the same class of unbounded
// identifier as workspace_id and session_id, which forbiddenMetricLabels
// rejects outright. Attribution falls to the structured logs and is uneven
// there: the two connection failures reach the Supervisor as a returned error
// and are logged with installation_id, while a blocked ingest queue is
// counted and nothing else — the counter says some bot is behind, not which.
