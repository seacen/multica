package wecom

// failure_origin_test.go — a chat_session bound to a WeCom room is not
// exclusively WeCom's, and that is as true of a run that failed as of one
// that answered.
//
// The engine makes the INSTALLER the creator of a group's chat_session, so
// that session appears in their own Multica chat list. They can open it in a
// browser and ask the agent something. Both runs die the same way — one
// task:failed on the shared bus, carrying the same chat_session_id — and
// nothing in the event says which surface asked. Without the question,
// sayTheRunFailed resolves the room off the binding row and announces, in
// front of everyone in it, that something they never saw has gone wrong.
//
// The first two tests are the pair that matters: the same event, the same
// session, opposite verdicts, decided only by where the question came from.
// The rest pin the branches where the origin cannot be established. This is an
// authorization check on writing into somebody else's group chat, so those
// refuse — a lookup that did not answer is not evidence the question came from
// WeCom — and the case that made fail-open tempting is covered without them,
// by the round state this process already holds.
