// rate_limit.go — everything that keeps aibot_send_msg inside WeCom's
// published quota: a per-chat gate in front of the write, and one short retry
// for the two errcodes that mean "not now" rather than "never".
//
// Both halves answer the same failure. WeCom refuses an over-quota push with
// errcode 45009, ws_sender turns that into a *wecomAPIError, and every caller
// on the outbound path reads a stated refusal as final — provablyNotSent says
// no re-offer, classifyDrop files platform_refused, and the reply is gone. One
// throttled frame is one answer the person never sees, with nothing on their
// screen to say so. The gate makes reaching that unlikely; the retry makes
// reaching it survivable.

// (.../path/90313).
//
// These are the documented ceilings THEMSELVES, not a margin under them. The
// copy of this file the outbound queue carried claimed they were "set below
// the documented ceilings on purpose"; that sentence was wrong about its own
// numbers and is deliberately not restored with them.
//
// One thing here is ours rather than WeCom's, and it is the reason the gate is
// not the only defence: that page carries no separate entry for aibot. Reading
// aibot_send_msg as counted under the generic per-member message limit is an
// ASSUMPTION we have not been able to source. The retry below is what covers
// us being wrong about it — if the real ceiling is lower, or counted over a

// outcome nobody can classify — unconfirmedReason has to call that unknown,
// and an unknown tells an operator to resend something the user may already
// have. Refusing early is the honest failure: nothing was written, so the

// deadline that ended the wait. A context error on this path means "we may
// have written and cannot tell" (unconfirmedReason), which is the opposite of
// what happened here: the gate is upstream of the socket, so this is provably
// nothing sent, and provablyNotSent's default answers it correctly. It lands

// outcome nobody can classify, and a lost answer is what we are here to avoid,

// path, so every frame for an installation is written by the replica holding

// this gate sees are exactly the frames WeCom is counting. The DB-backed gate
// this replaces needed shared state because the outbound queue let ANY replica
// claim a row and send it; with the queue gone, so is the reason.
//
// The scope has one seam: a reconnect mints a new wsSender with an empty
// window, so a socket that flaps mid-minute can put us over WeCom's count
// while ours reads clean. That is the case sendMsgFrame's retry exists for,
