// regression_media_budget_silence_test.go — what a person is owed when the
// photo they sent does not make it.
//
// The adapter already apologises for an attachment the resolver itself failed
// on: a dead COS link, a file over the size cap. But the resolver is not the
// only thing that can give up on an attachment. The engine Router wraps the
// whole ResolveMedia call in a media budget of its own, and when that budget
// runs out the Router drops the attachment references and lets the agent run
// on the "[Image]" placeholder. From the resolver's side nothing failed — it
// was cut off, or it never started — so the notice it owns is never written.
// The photo is gone and the chat says nothing about it: the person watches
// the bot answer the sentence they typed beside the picture as if the picture
// had never existed, and the only place it is recorded is a server log they
// cannot see.
//
// The tests here drive the two calls engine.Router.resolveAndBindMedia makes,
// in its order and with its contexts, against the real resolver over a real
// aibot socket. What they read is what the person reads: the frames on the
// socket.
