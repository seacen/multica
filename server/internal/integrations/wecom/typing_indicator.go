// typing_indicator.go — WeCom's answer to "the bot heard you".
//
// Slack stamps 👀 on the user's message, Feishu a typing badge. WeCom has
// neither: the smart-bot protocol publishes no reaction, no read receipt and
// no typing signal at all. What it does have is the streaming message, so the
// same engine.TypingNotifier interface means something different here — the
// indicator IS the reply, opened early and filled in later. Two consequences
// follow from that, and both shape this file:
//
//   - The bubble MUST be closed. A reaction that never clears is untidy; a
//     stream that never finishes is a spinner sitting in the user's chat for
//     good. So every way a turn can end — answered, failed, never started,
//     outlived its window — writes a closing frame carrying visible text.
//   - OnSettled is not the normal ending. As on the other platforms the Router
//     only calls it when the flush produced no task run; the answer closes the
//     bubble from the chat-done subscriber in outbound.go, which is the only
//     place that has the answer to close it with.
