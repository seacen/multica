// relay_relayed_send_test.go — what the LEASE HOLDER does with a frame another
// replica routed to it, driven through the REAL Outbound.deliverRelayed and the
// real dispatcher (DeliverWecomOutbound → perform → step).
//
// That is the whole point of this file. relay_ordering_db_test.go covers the
// dispatcher against a fake handler that returns an outcome directly
// (failsOnceHandler), so every property that lives INSIDE deliverRelayed — which
// counter moves, whether the claim goes back, what the socket actually received
// — was invisible to it: four rounds of tests passed while a single routed reply
// was recording a drop on every retry, and while a long answer's first piece was
// being printed twice.
//
// So the handler here is a real *Outbound over a real wsSender, and the socket
// double decides what fails. No database and no Redis: dedupe is nil, which is
// the single-replica claim gate, and the retry chain is the same code either way.
