package wecom

// wecom_channel.go — the Channel + Factory the engine.Supervisor drives, plus
// the WebSocket run loop for one aibot smart-bot connection. WeCom allows
// only one active connection per bot; the Supervisor's WS lease enforces
// that same "at most one per replica" invariant at the process layer, so the
// combination gives us a single global connection per installation without
// wecom-specific coordination.
//
// The read loop lives on this file (rather than in a shared connector as
// with lark/ws_connector.go) because the aibot protocol is small enough
// that a per-installation loop is clearer than an EventConnector abstraction.
// Slack takes the same shape in slack_channel.go — the per-installation
// receive loop is inlined into Channel.Connect.

// carries a chat id and no callback req_id — there is nothing here to reply
// in-window to.
//
// An earlier version of this comment justified the choice with a 5-second

// aibot_respond_welcome_msg and aibot_respond_update_msg, and a reply to a

// bot in that conversation; an unsolicited push to a chat nobody has messaged
// is refused. The other caveat is chat_type: aibot_send_msg needs to know
// whether the ChatID is a single-user id or a group id. We piggy-back on the
// length heuristic used by internal-customer-service (chat ids are ≥33 chars,
// userids are shorter), which is stable in practice.
//
// The Channel is not the primary outbound path in the multica engine — the
