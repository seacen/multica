// stream_round_identity_test.go — which run a bubble stands for, and the three
// ways that used to be guessed at.
//
// The bubble is a promise: this is where your answer will appear. Keeping it
// means knowing, for every message, which run will answer it, and for every
// ending, which bubble it belongs in. Both facts are carried in — the batch id
// from the debouncer that decides the boundary, the task id from the flush
// that creates the run — and these tests hold that shut from the outside: they
// drive the seam the Router drives, never the store's internals, so a store
// that went back to inferring either one fails them.

// (they arrive a full window apart) — the opposite of what the batcher
// decided, and both mistakes are user-visible: a merged pair loses the second
