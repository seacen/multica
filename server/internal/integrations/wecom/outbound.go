package wecom

// outbound.go — the WeCom EventChatDone subscriber. After an agent finishes
// producing a chat reply on the bus, this subscriber looks up the wecom
// chat_session binding, resolves the live wsSender through the shared
// registry, and pushes the reply back as aibot_send_msg. Mirrors
// slack.Outbound; sessions with no wecom binding are ignored so it
// coexists with Slack / Lark subscribers on the shared bus.
//
// Kept lean: aibot has no threading, no per-bot outbound REST, and no
// mrkdwn conversion — the reply text goes through sendMsgTextBody the
// same way OutboundReplier's messages do (markdown msgtype, which
// renders plaintext without escaping).
//
// SINGLE-REPLICA CONSTRAINT: WeCom's only outbound path is the in-process
// WebSocket held in the sendersRegistry, but EventChatDone / EventInboxNew are
// dispatched on the in-process events.Bus. On a multi-replica deployment the
// replica that publishes the event is not necessarily the one holding the
// bot's WS lease, so senders.get() returns nil and the reply cannot be
// delivered from here (Slack/Lark are immune — their outbound is stateless
// HTTP any replica can perform). Until outbound is routed to the lease holder,
// a WeCom-enabled backend must run as a single replica; boot emits a warning
// when a multi-replica setup (REDIS_URL) is detected. See router.go.
