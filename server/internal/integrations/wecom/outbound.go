package wecom

// outbound.go — the WeCom EventChatDone / EventInboxNew subscriber. An agent's
// answer leaves this process the way every other WeCom write does: over the
// aibot WebSocket held in the sendersRegistry. aibot has no outbound REST path,
// so there is nothing else to fall back on.
//
// Two shapes of write, tried in this order. A round that opened a bubble when
// the question arrived has its answer written INTO that bubble and the bubble
// sealed — that is the whole point of the streaming reply, and it is why an
// empty completion still has to reach this far: a spinner nobody closes is
// worse than a short answer (stream_store.go, typing_indicator.go). A round
// with no bubble left — a restart mid-run, a stream past its window, a frame
// the server refused — gets an ordinary message addressed by the task's own
// delivery row.
//
// REPLICA TOPOLOGY: EventChatDone / EventInboxNew are dispatched on the
// in-process events.Bus, so the replica that publishes an event is not
// necessarily the one holding the bot's WS lease (Slack/Lark are immune —
// their outbound is stateless HTTP any replica can perform). With a
// sharded/dual realtime relay running, a reply or inbox push produced
// off-lease is forwarded to the lease holder over the relay
// (relay_outbound.go) and the single-replica constraint no longer applies to
// routing. Without a relay — legacy mode, or no REDIS_URL — the constraint
// stands: run the WeCom-enabled backend as a single replica. In every mode, a
// delivery produced while NO replica holds a live connection (all of them
// mid-reconnect) is still lost; that residual window is a durability problem
// the relay deliberately does not solve. Boot logs which of the two regimes is
// in effect. See router.go.
//
// The bubble path and the relay never contend for the same turn. A bubble is
// writable only on the replica that painted it, which is the replica holding
// the socket; a round whose bubble lives elsewhere finds none here and takes
// the addressed path, which is where the relay is.
//
// They never MEET either, and that is a known gap rather than a property of the
// topology. The replica that takes a relayed reply is by definition the one
// holding the socket, which is the one with the bubble — and deliverRelayed
// pushes the words as an ordinary message without ever looking for it
// (relay_outbound.go). So on a multi-replica deployment the answer arrives, the
// bubble it belonged in stays open, and streamGuardAfter later seals it with
// "还在处理，完成后我再单独回复你": a promise of a separate reply the reader
// already has, sitting above it. Replies are delivered either way; the in-place
// bubble is a single-replica experience until a relayed reply is routed through
// the ending ledger on the replica that takes it (stream_store.go).
//
// Sessions with no wecom binding are ignored so this coexists with the Slack /
// Lark subscribers on the shared bus.
