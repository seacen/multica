package wecom

// strings.go — the copy the streaming bubble writes, in one place, selected
// per READER.
//
// IT CARRIES ONLY THE BUBBLE'S COPY. Everything else this adapter says — the
// offline and archived notices, the binding prompt, the inbox card's labels —
// is still the Chinese literal at its own call site, exactly as before. Those
// move here when they are translated; nothing about this file asks them to
// move first.
//
// Which pack a given bubble uses is decided by the DESTINATION, not by the
// installation (language.go): a 1:1 gets that person's Multica profile
// language, and a room — where there is no shared profile and no member list —
// gets the deployment's own language.
//
// Slack's adapter hardcodes English and Lark's hardcodes Chinese, so there is
// no house i18n mechanism to join. This is deliberately not one either: a
// struct of strings per locale. No catalogue files, no message ids, no plural
// rules. If wecom ever needs a third language with real formatting rules,
// that is the moment to reach for a framework — not now.
//
// The zh-Hans pack is the text a Chinese tenant reads; the English pack is for
// a reader whose Multica profile says anything else.

	// is a Chinese platform. It is what a deployment that says nothing gets.
	// Read deploymentLocale() rather than this — a deployment can say
	// otherwise, and a room's language is a property of the deployment, not of
	// whichever person happened to speak.

// is a room, or a person whose profile says nothing. Set once at boot from
// MULTICA_WECOM_DEFAULT_LOCALE (cmd/server/router.go) and read on every
// message, so it is an atomic rather than a plain var: -race would otherwise
// flag the boot write against the first inbound frame.
//
// It exists because the alternative answers are all worse. A hardcoded
// constant makes an English-speaking tenant's rooms Chinese with no way out
// but a rebuild. An installation-level column was tried and removed: nothing
// could write it. Borrowing the installer's personal profile language repeats,
// with a different person, the exact bug that motivated this — one member's
// setting deciding what a whole room reads. A deployment-level knob is the
// smallest thing that is actually about the deployment.

//
// Deliberately NOT resolveLocale. That one reads a user's profile field, which
// the API has already validated to en / zh-Hans / ko / ja, so it can treat
// "anything that isn't Chinese" as a deliberate choice of the English pack. An
// env var has been validated by nobody: under that rule
// MULTICA_WECOM_DEFAULT_LOCALE=zh_Hant, or a stray quote, would quietly put a
// Chinese tenant's rooms into English. So this one matches exactly, and an
// operator who mistypes gets the old language and a log line, not a surprise.

	//   say; the reply ahead of it already covered this message. A first

	//   archived, or the enqueue failed); the replier's own notice follows as

	//   its own. A failure that DID carry one says that instead (failureText
	//   in typing_indicator.go).
	// StreamCancelled — the user stopped the run, so no answer is coming.
	//   Separate copy from StreamFailed on purpose: inviting a retry of
	//   something somebody just stopped on purpose reads as the bot not having
	//   noticed.
	// StreamContinued — the run outlived one stream's window, so the bubble
	//   is sealed with this and the run carries on in a fresh bubble right
	//   underneath it (the rotation in typing_indicator.go's fireGuard). A

	//   it, the next bubble is already on screen.
