//
// The copy used to sit inline wherever it was sent: the offline and archived
// notices in replier.go, the binding prompt built by hand a few lines below
// them, the inbox card's type labels in inbox_message.go. All of it Chinese,
// which is right for our own tenant and wrong the moment anyone else installs
// the bot — and impossible to find, because "what does this bot say" was
// spread across three files.
//
// Which pack a given message uses is decided by the DESTINATION, not by the
// installation (language.go): a 1:1 gets that person's Multica profile
// language, and a room — where there is no shared profile and no member list —
// gets the deployment's own language.
//
// Slack's adapter hardcodes English and Lark's hardcodes Chinese, so there is
// no house i18n mechanism to join. This is deliberately not one either: a
// struct of strings per locale. No catalogue files, no message ids, no plural
// rules. If wecom ever needs a third language with real formatting rules,
// that is the moment to reach for a framework — not now.
//
// The zh-Hans pack is the text this adapter was already sending, character for
// character. Nothing a Chinese tenant reads changes here; the English pack is
// new.

// flag the boot write against the first inbound frame.
//
// It exists because the alternative answers are all worse. A hardcoded
// constant makes an English-speaking tenant's rooms Chinese with no way out
// but a rebuild. An installation-level column was tried and removed: nothing
// could write it. Borrowing the installer's personal profile language repeats,

// MULTICA_WECOM_DEFAULT_LOCALE=zh_Hant, or a stray quote, would quietly put a

	// StreamNoReply — the agent finished with nothing to say.

	//   say; the reply ahead of it already covered this message. A first
	//   round's empty finish keeps StreamNoReply, which has no earlier answer
	//   to point at.
	// StreamNotStarted — no run was triggered at all (agent offline or
	//   archived, or the enqueue failed); the replier's own notice follows as
	//   a separate message with the detail.
	// StreamFailed — the run failed.
	// StreamCancelled — the user stopped the run, so no answer is coming.
	//   Separate copy from StreamFailed on purpose: inviting a retry of
	//   something somebody just stopped on purpose reads as the bot not having
	//   noticed.
	// StreamStillWorking — the run outlived the protocol's stream window, so
	//   we close the bubble ourselves and answer separately later.
	// StreamNoReplyWithFiles — the agent finished with no words but produced
	// files, which arrive as separate messages right after this one. Distinct
	// from StreamNoReply because that copy says nothing is coming, and then
	// something arrives: a bubble that contradicts the next message reads as a
	// bug even though both halves are working.
	// TaskFailedNotice, TaskFailedAgentFallback and TaskFailedReason are the
	// outbound queue's own failure notice (outbox_sender.go): a run that ended
	// without an answer, said by whichever replica drains the row rather than
	// by the bubble that was watching it. Separate from StreamFailed because
	// this one names the agent and can carry the platform's reason — and
	// because it is rendered from a stored payload at send time, which is why
	// the language it is written in travels on the row.
	//
	// TaskFailedNotice's %s is the agent's name; TaskFailedAgentFallback
