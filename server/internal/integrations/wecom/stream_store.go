// stream_store.go — the handles that let each answer land in the bubble its
// question opened.
//
// WeCom's aibot API has no typing indicator, no reaction, no read receipt, and
// no way to edit a message after the fact. The one affordance it does have is
// the streaming message: an aibot_respond_msg frame with finish=false paints a
// bubble the client renders as "working", and a later frame carrying the SAME
// stream.id replaces that bubble's body in place — finish=true seals it and
// nothing can touch it again
// (https://developer.work.weixin.qq.com/document/path/101463).
//
// A session holds a LIST of open bubbles, not one. Messages the engine's
// debouncer collects into one agent run share a bubble; a message it gives a
// run of its own gets a bubble of its own, queued behind the run in flight —
// immediately, because a message that produces nothing on screen reads as a
// message that was lost.
//
// WHICH RUN A BUBBLE STANDS FOR IS NEVER INFERRED HERE. Both halves of that
// question are answered upstream and carried in:
//
//   - engine.RunBatchID says which messages are one run. The batcher decides
//     it under the lock that arms and retires the debounce window, so two
//     messages share an id if and only if one flush answers both. Re-deriving
//     it here from arrival times would be a second measurement of the same
//     gap, taken on a detached goroutine, and near the window boundary the two
//     disagree about how many runs exist — one bubble for two runs, or a
//     bubble no run will ever close.
//   - The task id arrives with the flush that created the run
//     (TypingNotifier.OnRunStarted), so every later lifecycle event matches a
//     round by id rather than by position. An auto-retry clone carries a fresh
//     id and inherits its parent's chat_input_task_id, which is this same
//     round's task id — see roundTaker, which resolves the clone through it
//     for all three of the things an ending can do: take the bubble, claim the
//     promise left where a bubble used to be, or settle that promise silently.
//
// The rounds stay ordered by batch id, which is the order the runs execute in:
// the engine serializes chat tasks per session (ClaimAgentTask), so the oldest
// round is the running one and everything behind it is waiting. That ordering
// is what QueuedBehind reads; nothing else depends on it any more.
//
// The catch is req_id. Every frame of one stream has to echo the req_id of the
// aibot_msg_callback that started the turn, and that value is only ever seen
// by the WebSocket read loop. The answer shows up minutes later on an event
// bus subscriber holding nothing but a chat_session_id. This store is the seam
// between the two: session in, {req_id, stream id, addressing} out.
//
// IN-MEMORY IS THE RIGHT STORAGE, and deliberately so. One bot is one long
// connection, and the Supervisor's WS lease already guarantees at most one
// replica holds it, so a handle is only ever useful in the process that
// created it. A restart loses the handles, which is exactly right: the socket
// the req_ids belonged to is gone too, so the answers fall back to plain
// messages — degraded, not corrupted. Persisting them would buy nothing and
// promise a bubble no surviving socket could write to.
//
// Replay is not this file's problem. WeCom redelivers callbacks after a
// reconnect, but a redelivered frame loses the dedup claim in
// channel_inbound_message_dedup and never reaches OutcomeIngested, so it never
// reaches the typing indicator either. What this file does bound is the
// protocol's own window: a stream past streamMaxAge is refused by the server,
// and a handle past that age is worse than no handle at all — it would swallow
// the answer instead of delivering it.
