// DefaultChatRunBatchWindow is the silence window the inbound debouncer waits
// before triggering an agent run for a chat session. 3s (MUL-2968): long
// enough to absorb a "forward a transcript, then type a note" burst into one
// run, short enough that the bot's first reply is not perceptibly late.
const DefaultChatRunBatchWindow = 3 * time.Second

// RunBatchID names the set of messages this debouncer collected into one agent
// run. It is the batcher's own verdict, not an inference from it: Schedule
// decides under the same lock that arms and retires the window, so two
// messages share an id if and only if the same flush will answer both.
//
// A platform that shows a per-run affordance (WeCom paints a streaming bubble
// the answer later replaces in place) needs exactly this and cannot re-derive
// it. Re-measuring the gap on the ingest path answers the same question with a
// second clock, and the two disagree near the window boundary — the run count
// and the affordance count then differ, which is visible to the user in both
// directions. See wecom/stream_store.go for what the id is used for.
//
// Ids are unique per process and never zero. Minting starts at 1 and
// Router.scheduleRun mints one line above the branch that checks for a
// debouncer, so a notifier is never handed a zero: with batching disabled each
// message still gets a fresh id of its own, and OnIngested only fires for a
// message that scheduled a run.
//
// They are NOT a clock. The counter is atomic, but it is read outside the
// batcher's lock, so a message holding 6 can reach the batcher ahead of one
// holding 5 — "larger id" does not order two batches minted concurrently.
// Nothing depends on it: the only comparison in the tree is wecom's
// queuedBehind, which chooses between two strings for an answer that came back
// empty. What an id does guarantee is identity — two messages carry the same
// one if and only if the same flush will answer both — and that is what a
// per-run affordance actually needs.

// pendingBatcher debounces the per-chat_session run trigger. Each inbound
// message that lands in a session calls Schedule, which (re)arms a single
// timer for that session; when the session goes quiet for the window the
// latest flush runs exactly once. This collapses a burst into ONE agent run —
// safe because the chat task reads the WHOLE session at run time. Only the run
// TRIGGER is debounced; the chat_message rows, dedup, and frame ACK already
// happened synchronously upstream.
//
// State is in-process, keyed by chat_session_id (a globally-unique UUID). The
// WS lease guarantees a single active owner per installation, so a session is
// debounced by one process. A hard crash inside the window drops the pending
// trigger (messages are durable; they just do not fire a run until the next
// message). Graceful shutdown calls FlushAll so that boundary is not hit on a
// normal restart. Goroutine-safe; one instance is shared across supervisors.
