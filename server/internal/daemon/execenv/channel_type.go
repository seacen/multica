// (handler/daemon.go); an empty value means a web/mobile chat session with no
// IM channel behind it.
//
// These are plain string constants on purpose: the daemon compares a value the
// server already serialized to JSON, and must not pull the server-side
// integration packages (integrations/slack, integrations/lark) into its own
// build just to read one discriminator. The canonical definitions live with
// their adapters — slack.TypeSlack and channel.TypeFeishu — and both sides
// agree on the wire strings below. WeCom keeps its reserved wire discriminator
// here until its adapter lands.
