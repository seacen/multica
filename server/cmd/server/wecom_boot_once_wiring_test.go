// The defect these two guard is a merge that lands the same piece of boot-time
// wiring twice.
//
// On 2026-08-10 the deployed backend logged `wecom deployment locale
// locale=zh-Hans` twice on boot. Two branches each carried the same eleven
// lines of router.go — a comment plus the slog.Info wrapping
// wecom.SetDeploymentLocale — and git merged both without reporting a conflict,
// because the two copies landed at slightly different offsets and neither
// overlapped the other's context. Five branches carry a copy, so any two of
// them merging reproduces it.
//
// Nothing caught it. The compiler and go vet catch a duplicate *declaration*;
// this is a duplicate *statement*, and it survived go build, go vet, gofmt and
// the whole -race suite. It surfaced because a human read the boot log.
//
// That it was harmless is luck: SetDeploymentLocale is last-write-wins, so the
// second call set the same value. The same merge over `wecomTyping.Register(bus)`
// subscribes every task:failed handler twice and writes the failure notice into
// the user's chat twice; over the outbound subscriber, it answers every question
// twice.
//
// Note what the compiler DOES cover, because it decides what is left here: a
// duplicated `x := f()` at the same block scope is "no new variables on left
// side of :=" and never builds. So most of the WeCom block's constructors need
// no guard. What builds cleanly when duplicated is a bare call statement, a
// call inside a fresh scope (`if raw := ...; raw != "" { ... }`), and an append
// — and that is exactly the set covered below.
//
// The two halves split on observability, not on taste:
//
//   - TestWecomBootWiringSubscribesExactlyOnce drives the real boot path and
//     counts what the wiring actually did. It is the stronger evidence, and it
//     catches a duplicate however it arrives — through a helper, from another
//     file, from a second NewRouter call site. It can only see wiring that
//     leaves a countable trace, which here means bus subscriptions.
//
//   - TestWecomBootWiringIsWrittenExactlyOnce reads router.go. It covers what
//     no runtime assertion can: SetDeploymentLocale, SetTrace and
//     SetMediaAllowedPrefixes all write package state and are idempotent, so a
//     second call leaves nothing behind to count. Source-level counting is the
//     only way to see them, and it is what would have caught the 2026-08-10
//     defect.

// TestWecomBootWiringSubscribesExactlyOnce asserts that each bus subscription
// the WeCom boot block owns is made exactly once.
//
// Two routers are built on two fresh buses, one with the WeCom key set and one
// without, and the difference between them is what the WeCom block did. The
// delta has to be exactly one per event: the sibling wiring tests assert `> 0`,
// which answers "is it wired" and is blind to the same block running twice.
//
// A nil pool is deliberate: nothing in the WeCom boot block queries the
// database, and metrics_test.go boots the same way.
