-- name: RecordChannelOutboundDelivered :one
-- Records a delivery that never went through the queue, as a row that is
-- already terminal.
--
-- The reconciler infers a lost reply from the ABSENCE of a row for a terminal
-- task. That inference is sound only while every outbound send is an enqueue.
-- A channel whose platform has an in-window reply breaks it: a frame addressed
-- by the req_id of the callback that opened the turn can only be written by
-- the connection that received that callback, so it can never be a claimable
-- row and it leaves over the socket with nothing behind it. The reconciler
-- then reads a delivered reply as a dropped one and sends it again — the user
-- reads the answer, and reads it a second time a minute later.
--
-- So a delivery path that bypasses the queue owes the queue this row. It is
-- the same tombstone CompleteClaimedChannelOutbound leaves behind, written
-- directly, which is what makes it need no special handling anywhere else: the
-- unique index in migration 267 dedupes it against a racing enqueue, the NOT
-- EXISTS in ListChannelOutboundReconcileCandidates skips the task, and
-- PurgeSentChannelOutboundQueueBefore removes it on the same retention.
--
-- payload is left empty on purpose. The row is a record that a message went
-- out, not a copy of it, and the body was already rendered and written by the
-- path that delivered it.
